# 🌤️ Weather App

A simple weather app built to get hands-on experience working with external APIs. Enter a city and get real-time weather data back — a great first step into the world of API integration.

## 🚀 Features

- Search weather by city name
- Displays current temperature and conditions
- Dynamic icons for sunny and cloudy weather
- Clean, minimal UI

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Vite
- Weather API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)

## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🔑 API Setup

This app uses a weather API to fetch live data. To run it locally:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (or whichever API you used)
2. Add your key to the project — either directly in the script or via a `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to make API requests with `fetch`
- Handling async/await and JSON responses
- Dynamically updating the DOM based on API data
- Working with API keys and understanding rate limits
